Before joining NDU, I received my MSc majored in computer science at BUPT supervised by Professor Chuan Shi. I enjoy doing research on graph machine learning. 

Besides research, I maintain a wide range of hobbies including reading, climbing, and playing fingerstyle guitar. I take great pleasure in training my mind (meditation) and body (climbing, body building). I'm the founder and organizer of Microsoft (Beijing) Intern Guitar Club (Feel free to drop at our monthly guitar session ðŸ˜†).
