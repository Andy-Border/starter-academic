# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am currently a research intern at Microsoft Research Asia and preparing for application of CS PhD (2022 Fall). Before that, I was pursuing a PhD degree at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) with T. and D. Schroeder Associate Professor Yanfang (Fanny) Ye. Unfortunately, due to the visa restrictions of 10043 act, I cannot study in US. Hence, regrettably, I have to apply for a PhD outside US. Before joining CWRU, I received my MSc majored in computer science at BUPT supervised by Professor Chuan Shi. My research interests are machine Learning, graph mining, and representation learning.
